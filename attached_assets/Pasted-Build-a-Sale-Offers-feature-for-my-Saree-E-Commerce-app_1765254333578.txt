Build a "Sale & Offers" feature for my Saree E-Commerce application.

Project Requirements:
---------------------

1. Tech Stack:
   - Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
   - Frontend: React or simple HTML/CSS/JS pages
   - Admin Panel: React-based
   - API should be RESTful

2. Offer Types Needed:
   - Percentage discount (e.g., 20% OFF)
   - Flat discount (e.g., ₹300 OFF)
   - Category-level offers (e.g., Silk Sarees 30% OFF)
   - Product-level offers (attach offer to selected sarees)
   - Flash sale with start/end time + countdown timer
   - Coupon codes (e.g., FESTIVE10)

3. Backend Features:
   - Create offers table/collection:
       fields: offerName, offerType, discountValue, startDate, endDate,
               appliesTo (product/category/all), couponCode, status
   - Create mapping between offer and products
   - Auto-apply offer if time is active
   - API routes:
       POST /offers
       GET /offers
       GET /offers/active
       POST /offers/applyCoupon
       GET /products/:id (return product with final price after discount)

4. Admin Panel Features:
   - Create/edit/delete offers
   - Select products for offer
   - Set start & end date/time
   - Activate/deactivate offers
   - Dashboard showing:
       - Active offers
       - Total users using coupons
       - Sale performance

5. Frontend Features:
   - Product page shows:
        Original Price (striked)
        Sale Price (calculated using offer)
        % OFF badge
   - Flash sale countdown timer
   - Sale banner section
   - Coupon apply input in cart
   - List all products under current sales

6. Logic Requirements:
   - finalPrice = originalPrice - discountValue
   - OR finalPrice = originalPrice * (1 - discountValue/100)
   - If flash sale: final price only inside time range
   - Only one highest discount should be applied if multiple offers exist

7. Deliverables:
   - Express backend with all offer routes
   - MongoDB schema for offers and product-offer mapping
   - React admin panel for managing offers
   - Frontend components to show discounted price + countdown timers
   - Sample data seeds for saree products
   - Instructions to run backend & frontend on Replit

Build this entire system as a functioning project.
